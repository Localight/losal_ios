**App Security **  
This app is built on Localism's CEP and has the following security features:
Only members of the school community who have been verified have full access to app content (level 1 access).  This level of access only displays students using an obfuscated "persona" format (avatar, first name and last initial), and the posts do not link to the students' real social media profiles.  

For posts to appear in the app, they must be:

* Photos that are already publicly available on the internet from Twitter, Instagram or Facebook
* Tagged with #losal
* Submitted by verified students (in-person verification at school) 
* From students who have successfully completed two-factor authentication for their smartphone

Level 2 access is for verified parents, faculty and staff.  Verification for adults includes in-person verification, and two-factor smartphone authentication.  Adults have the ability to see all posts and the obfuscated persona of the student, but they do not have the ability to "like" or "favorite" posts. 

Level 3 access is for non-verified app users. They only see a photo wall in the social feed. They do not see textual content of posts or the obfuscated persona.

**Privacy and server security**  
Localism Inc.'s CEP is 100% FERPA-compliant meeting or exceeding applicable provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g. Privacy and security measures are in place to protect user data and data transfer. The privacy and security of student data is our first priority.
